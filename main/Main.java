         * After brainstorming on my whiteboard for a whole day, searching the internet for DP examples, watching videos and asking an LLM to think alongside me I managed to squeeze the following concept
         * We should approach this as a state-based problem represented by a 4-dimensional array with recursion and memoization. It can also be represented by a DAG directed acyclical graph (which is what I used to draw examples and manually compute)
         * states are represented by paths[r][c][s][k] where R are rows, c are columns, s is the number of maxConsecutiveJumps (a counter) and k is the number of jumps in the current test case (another counter)
         *
         * it goes something like
         *
         * countPaths(r,c,s,k){
         *  if (this state is invalid) -> return 0 // need to write verifications for IS this tile out of bounds; is it nullTile #; is k > N; is s > M
         *
         *  if (this is the endGoal) -> return 1 // need to write a verification for endGoal (if r == R-1 and c== C-1 means its the end of the grid)
         *
         *  if (this countPaths(r,c,s,k) already exists in memory, saved in our structure) -> return it from the structure
         *
         *  int paths = 0
         *
         *  considering regular moves (no jumps)
         *  paths += countPaths(r, c+1, s, 0) move right
         *  paths += countPaths(r+1, c, s, 0) move down
         *
         *  considering jumps
         *  if s < M and k < N:
         *  paths += countPaths(r+2, c, s+1, k+1) down-down jump
         *
         *  if thisTile != J and thisTile != X:
         *  paths += countPaths(r+1, c+1, s+1, k+1) down right jump
         *  paths += countPaths(r+1, c-1, s+1, k+1) down left jump
         *
         *  store paths in memory structure
         *  return paths
         *
